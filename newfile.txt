Kubernetes lets you create, deploy, manage, and scale application containers across one or more host clusters. 

Environments running Kubernetes consist of the following key components:

Kubernetes control plane—manages Kubernetes clusters and the workloads running on them. Include components like the API Server, Scheduler, and Controller Manager.
Kubernetes data plane—machines that can run containerized workloads. Each node is managed by the kubelet, an agent that receives commands from the control plane. 
Pods—pods are the smallest unit provided by Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads.  A pod typically includes several containers, which together form a functional unit or microservice.
Persistent storage—local storage on Kubernetes nodes is ephemeral, and is deleted when a pod shuts down. This can make it difficult to run stateful applications. Kubernetes provides the Persistent Volumes (PV) mechanism, allowing containerized applications to store data beyond the lifetime of a pod or node.
This is part of an extensive series of guides about CI/CD.
